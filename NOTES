* Short-term tasks
** TODO Split git_shell_ext.[ch] into multiple files
   One per interface provided by the extension?  Perhaps less verbose
   filenames, as well.
** TODO Move context menu item up a bit.  Sorting is off.
** TODO Generate registry installation/uninstallation entries during build.
   Need to not hard-code the dll path, at least.
* Mid-term tasks
** TODO Flesh out menu items provided to the user.
* Long-term tasks
** TODO Property page.
** TODO File icons.
